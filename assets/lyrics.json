    "Velocity\nIs the change in position\nDivided by time\nVelocity\nIs speed with direction\nInitial velocity\nRefers to when you start\nFinal velocity\nRefers to when you’re done\nDisplacement\nIs the change in position\nAcceleration\nIs the change in velocity\nDivided by time\nWhere the motion speeds up\nOr the motion slows down\nIts caused by a force\nApplied over time.\n\n\nMusic & lyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-2" : 
    "It’s a good class\nWe learn about physics\nStudied motion\nand the way that things flow\nVelocity\nand acceleration\nObjects stopping\nand starting to go\n\nNow were ready\nFor vertical motion\nWhere gravity\nalways pulls things down\nAcceleration\ndue to this force\nMakes velocity fast\njust as it strikes the ground\n\nNow we’ll study free\nFree falling\n\n\nWhen an object falls\nfrom up in the air\nIts velocity\nstarted at rest\nThe time it takes to\nreach the highest point\nIs the same as\nthe time to come down\n\n9 point 8  1\nmeters per second squared\nIs the rate which\ngravity acts\nVertical motion\nhas the same methods\nAs horizontal\nEquations and facts\n\n\n\nMusic by Tom Petty\nLyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-3" : 
    "Just the other day\nI bowed my head and began to pray\nThat the Lord might deliver me from my gloom\nTriangles and me\nDidn’t work well and we\nWere in a debacle and I didn’t have much room\nMy teacher looked at me\nHe said, “I can plainly see\nSon, you’ve got the Trigometric Blues\nListen carefully\nTo these wise words from me\nAnd everything will come into view”\n\nWhen you got adjacent and hypotenuseWe call that cosine\nAnd opposite over hypotenuse\nIs called Sine   oohh\nThe opposite over adjacent\nIs the tangent function\nThat’s why I no longer have the trigometric blues\n\nOh -   How did I know\nOslo from Tokyo\nI had my direction vectors all misconstrued\nNow I plainly see\nBerlin from NYC\nWith Trig I’m no longer confused\n\nUp and down for me\nWas an impossibility\nVectors had me biting on my nails\nApplied to velocity\nI had a party of pity\nBut Trig came along and now I never fail\n\nAccelerati-on\nFelt like a had a ton\nOf mass on my shoulders & I didn’t know what to do\nBut Big Tex showed me\nThe Trig functions and we\nHere ended my Trigometric Blues\n\n\n\n\nMusic & lyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-4" : 
    "Objects at rest usually stay\nObjects in motion keep going that way\nUnless they encounter an outside force\nThey stay at rest or maintain the same course\n\nThe sum of the forces will be a big zero\nIf the objects at rest or in constant motion\nIf it changes speed or changes direction\nThen a force was the cause of the objects deflection\n\nNewton saw an apple fall from a tree\nAnd made Gravity a part of history\n\nWhen there’s a push or pull on an object\nThere is a force\nThe mass times acceleration\nMeasures the force\n\n\nThe normal force acts away from the earth\nPerpendicular to the surface\nFor every action force that exists\nAn equal reactive force resists\n\nGravity is a force of two things attracting\nThe strength depends on the mass each is packing\nOur weight is gravity pulling us down\nMass times acceleration toward the ground\n\n\nFriction is a force that slows things down\nIts direction is parallel to the ground\nBetween the surfaces during the ride\nOpposite to the way things slide\n\n\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-5" : 
    "As you walk to the top of a building\nYour gain potential energy\nYou do work    moving your mass\nAgainst the force of gravity\nAnd if you let go of an object\nSo it starts falling down\nIt loses potential    gaining speed\nAs it moves toward the ground\n\nEnergy is conserved\nNever lost and never gained\nStored potential plus moving kinetic\nThe total is maintained\nPotential Energy is m –g –h\nThe energy that is stored\nKinetic is one half m – v squared\nFrom the object moving more\n\nAs you push an object against a spring\nYou store potential energy\nHalf the Spring Constant by displacement squared\nIs the formula that you need\n\nWork – Work\nForce times displacement\nWork – Work\nEnergy is changing\nWork – Work\nMeasured in Joules\nWork – Work\nEnergy is used\n\n\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-6" : 
    "Momentum\nMass times’ velocity\nA conserved quantity\nIf there’s a collision\n\nMomentum\nIt’s zero when at rest\nAnd with velocity has\nThe same direction\n\nElastic Collisions\nDon’t stick together\nThe two parts\nCollide and remain apart\n\nInelastic collisions\nThey stick Together\nThe two parts\nCollide and share one heart\n\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-7" : 
    "I see a satellite experiencing gravity\nAbove the earth going round and round\nI see a satellite experiencing gravity\nThe force is directed toward the ground\n\nIt’s going round in circles\nLike a bird up in the sky\nIt’s going round in circles\nCentripetal force has got me high\n\nI’m twirling an object on a string today\nIt’s velocity’s tangent to its path\nI’m twirling an object on a string today\nAccelerating toward the center, makes me laugh\n\nIf centripetal force equals gravity\nThe object wont go up or down\nIf centripetal force equals gravity\nThe object wont go up or down\n\nVelocity decreases with a shorter radius\nThe period is the time to get around\nVelocity decreases with a shorter radius\nThe period is the time to get around\n\n\nOriginal Music by Billy Preston\nLyrics rewritten by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-8" : 
    "Shuffling across the dance floor in my brand new Stetsons\nKickin up a charge each and every step of the way\nMy honey got a shock from me when I went to kiss her\nElectricity was flowing, but not the way I planned\n\nWell, those electrons were jumpin\nCaused by contact production\nBut sometimes induction\nIs the cause anyway\nSparks were a flying\nThere’s no use denying\nNow, I’m left crying\nCause I zapped by baby\n\nI induced a charge by standing close to my woman\nOpposites attract, but not when you’ve been wronged\nThis time I went to hold her, but what a shock to find out\nShe tasered me and left me all alone there on the floor\n\nThe force between two charges is the product in coulombs\nDivided by the square of the distance between the two\nMultiplied by the constant K and don’t forget direction\nCoulomb’s law measures electrostatic force\n\nThe electric field flows from positive to minus\nActing on a point charge that’s positive and small\nThe lines are most dense where the field is stronger\nVan de Graaff knew how to put electrons on that ball\n\n\nLyrics and Music by Ray Depta",
    "Unit-9" : 
    "Current’s the amount of charge passin\nIn a given amount of time\nAn Amp is the unit current has\nUsing the variable I\n Flowing from positive in a loop\nToward negative each bout\nWhatever current enters in one path\nIs the current that comes out\n\nBut you gotta know V equals I R\nTo solve voltage and current flows\nIts one equation used again and again\nTo solve circuits you gotta know\nOhm’s Law\n\nVoltage is the amount of potential gained\nOr lost as current flows\nIt drops thru resistors producing heat\nAnd raised by a batteries go\nMeasured in volts using the letter V\nVoltmeters are connected across \nThe rise from a battery separating charge\nEquals the total resistor loss\n\nR for resistance slows current down\nDropping voltage as it goes\nLength increases and width decreases\nThe amount a resistor slows\nMeasured in ohms using little omega\ninsulators have a lot\nHeaters & light bulbs glow all day\nAs resistors can get hot\n\nIn series resistors add up\nThe currents the same through all\nDropping voltage thru each one as it goes\nMaking the total voltage fall\nIn parallel the total resistance is less\nYou use the inverse law\nThe voltage drops across each is the same\nAs the current splits into all\n\n\nMusic & lyrics by Ray Depta",

    "The right hand rules\nIt gives us the tools\nFor figurin out direction\nOf magnets in my school\nI can tell you that the force\nIs par for the course\nMagnetic induction \nHas got to be the source\nCurrent bearing wire\nHas the desire\nTo deflect up or down\nAs it feels magnetic fire\nThumb it for the current\nForefinger for the field\nHelps a brother & sister\nKnow the way the force is yielded\n\nmoving a wire\nin a magnetic fire\ncauses a current\nto get a bit higher\nThat’s how we create\nElectricity is generated\nWater moving coiled wires \nin large magnets\n\nA wire with a current\nStarts a motor purrin\nThe secret is has\nA magnetic field that’s fervent\n\nA coil moving up and down\nProduces a sound\nWhen current passing through it\nMagnets go and pound it\n\nForce equals current\nTimes the magnetic fields torrent\nBy the length of the wire\nThe speaker is a burnin\n\nOr the charge that is moving\nBy the velocity grooving\ntimes the magnetic field\nIt’ time that we’ve proven\n\n\nMusic & Lyric by Ray Depta",

    "Frequently, I wonder\nHow do I know?\nAs my baby surfs the waves\nWhat makes her go?\nAmplitude is measured\nFrom rest -to peak\nMe and my baby were\nCheek to cheek\n\nVelocity is frequency times wavelength\nAmplitude measures the waves strength\nFrequency is the number of cycles\nTo come around\n\nLongitudinal waves move\nThe medium around\nParallel to the wave\nPassing along the sound\nCrest to crest\nOne Wavelength at a time\nOr trough to trough\nWorks all the time\n\nAs the frequency gets faster\nthe wavelength gets shorter\nWhen we make it longer\nOur frequency gets lower\n\nTransverse waves move the medium\nUP and down\nExcept for light, the wave moves\nCross the ground\nStanding waves nodes are where\nThe wave’s at rest\nAntinodes \nIs where the sound’s the best\n\nConstructive interference\nThe amplitude gets tall\nDestructive Interference\nThe amplitude gets small\n\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Ray Depta"
